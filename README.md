# Python Games

These are a few games that created for projects/assignments for my CS65 (Intro to Computer Science I) class in my sophomore year

* Hangman: You may need to open the specific folder to ensure that all the directories are correct
* Shut the box: Run the file as is, and it should run in the shell
